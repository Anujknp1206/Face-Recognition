# Face Recognition Attendance System üë§üìä

A Python-based application that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This system captures employee/student faces, trains a recognition model, and records attendance automatically when authorized faces are detected.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Face Detection**: Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- **Face Recognition**: LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm
- **Attendance Tracking**: Automatic recording with timestamps
- **User Management**: Add multiple users with unique IDs
- **Data Export**: Save attendance records to CSV
- **Modern UI**: Intuitive graphical interface with Tkinter

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

- Python 3.6+
- Webcam
- Recommended: Good lighting conditions

## Installation Guide üì•

Usage Flow (3-Step Process)
1Ô∏è‚É£ First: Capture Face Dataset
Run to register new users and capture face samples:


python face_dataset.py
Enter User ID when prompted

Face the camera - system will capture 30 samples

Creates images in dataset/ folder (User.{ID}.{Count}.jpg)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Second: Train the Model
Run to process captured faces and train recognizer:


python training.py
Processes all images in dataset/

Generates trainer.yml (trained model file)

Wait for "X faces trained" confirmation

3Ô∏è‚É£ Third: Run Recognition System
Launch the attendance tracking interface:

python Face_Recognition.py
Detects faces in real-time

Automatically records recognized users

Displays confidence percentage
